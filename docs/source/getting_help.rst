Reporting Bugs and Asking Questions
------------------------------------

Questions, bug reports and feature requests are happily accepted via the
`GitHub Issue Tracker <https://github.com/jantman/awslimitchecker/issues>`_.
Pull requests are welcome. Issues that don't have an accompanying pull request
will be worked on as my time and priority allows, but I'll do my best to
complete feature requirements as long as it's possible.

IRC

I can often be found on `freenode <https://freenode.net/>`_ as "jantman".
