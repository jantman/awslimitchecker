Command Line Usage
===================

awslimitchecker ships with a command line script for use outside of
Python environments. ``awslimitchecker`` is installed as a
`setuptools entry point <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#entry-points>`_,
and will be available wherever you install the package (if you install
in a virtual environment as recommended, it will be in the venv's ``bin/`` directory).

The command line script provides simple access to the most common features,
though not full access to all configuration possibilities. In addition, when checking
usage, the script will exit 0 of everything is OK, 1 if there are warnings, and 2 if there
are critical thresholds exceeded (though the output is not currently suitable for direct
use as a Nagios-compatible plugin).

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker --help
   usage: awslimitchecker [-h] [-S SERVICE] [-s] [-l] [--list-defaults]
                          [-L LIMIT] [-u] [--iam-policy] [-W WARNING_THRESHOLD]

Examples
---------

In the following examples, **output has been truncated** to simplify documentation.
When running with all services enabled, ``awslimitchecker`` will provide *many* lines
of output. ``(...)`` has been inserted in the output below to denote removed
or truncated lines.

Listing Supported Services
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

View the AWS services currently supported by ``awslimitchecker`` with the
``-s`` or ``--list-services`` option.

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -s
   AutoScaling
   CloudFormation
   EBS
   EC2
   ELB
   (...)
   RDS
   S3
   SES
   VPC



Listing Default Limits
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To show the hard-coded default limits, ignoring any limit overrides
or Trusted Advisor data, run with ``--list-defaults``:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker --list-defaults
   AutoScaling/Auto Scaling groups                        20
   AutoScaling/Launch configurations                      100
   CloudFormation/Stacks                                  200
   EBS/Active snapshots                                   10000
   EBS/Active volumes                                     5000
   (...)
   VPC/Rules per network ACL                              20
   VPC/Subnets per VPC                                    200
   VPC/VPCs                                               5



Viewing Limits
+++++++++++++++

View the limits that ``awslimitchecker`` currently knows how to check, and what
the limit value is set as (if you specify limit overrides, they will be used
instead of the default limit) by specifying the ``-l`` or ``--list-limits``
option. Limits followed by ``(TA)`` have been obtained from Trusted Advisor
and limits followed by ``(API)`` have been obtained from the service's API.

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -l
   AutoScaling/Auto Scaling groups                        650 (API)
   AutoScaling/Launch configurations                      1000 (API)
   CloudFormation/Stacks                                  1000 (API)
   EBS/Active snapshots                                   20000 (TA)
   EBS/Active volumes                                     6500 (TA)
   (...)
   VPC/Rules per network ACL                              20
   VPC/Subnets per VPC                                    200
   VPC/VPCs                                               1000 (TA)



Disabling Trusted Advisor Checks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using the ``--skip-ta`` option will disable attempting to query limit information
from Trusted Advisor for all commands.

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -l --skip-ta
   AutoScaling/Auto Scaling groups                        650 (API)
   AutoScaling/Launch configurations                      1000 (API)
   CloudFormation/Stacks                                  1000 (API)
   EBS/Active snapshots                                   10000
   EBS/Active volumes                                     5000
   (...)
   VPC/Rules per network ACL                              20
   VPC/Subnets per VPC                                    200
   VPC/VPCs                                               5



Checking Usage
+++++++++++++++

The ``-u`` or ``--show-usage`` options to ``awslimitchecker`` show the current
usage for each limit that ``awslimitchecker`` knows about. It will connect to the
AWS API and determine the current usage for each limit. In cases where limits are
per-resource instead of account-wide (i.e. "Rules per VPC security group" or
"Security groups per VPC"), the usage will be reported for each possible resource
in ``resource_id=value`` format (i.e. for each VPC security group and each VPC, respectively,
using their IDs).

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -u
   AutoScaling/Auto Scaling groups                        492
   AutoScaling/Launch configurations                      581
   CloudFormation/Stacks                                  812
   EBS/Active snapshots                                   15548
   EBS/Active volumes                                     4937
   (...)
   VPC/Rules per network ACL                              max: acl-bde47dd9=6 (acl-4bd96a2e=4, acl-e93a (...)
   VPC/Subnets per VPC                                    max: vpc-c89074a9=37 (vpc-ae7bc5cb=1, vpc-1e5 (...)
   VPC/VPCs                                               13



Overriding Limits
++++++++++++++++++

In cases where you've been given a limit increase by AWS Support, you can override
the default limits with custom ones. Currently, to do this from the command line,
you must specify each limit that you want to override separately (the
:py:meth:`~.AwsLimitChecker.set_limit_overrides` Python method accepts a dict for
easy bulk overrides of limits) using the ``-L`` or ``--limit`` options. Limits are
specified in a ``service_name/limit_name=value`` format, and must be quoted if the
limit name contains spaces.

For example, to override the limits of EC2's "EC2-Classic Elastic IPs" and
"EC2-VPC Elastic IPs" from their defaults of 5, to 10 and 20, respestively:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -L "AutoScaling/Auto Scaling groups"=321 --limit="AutoScaling/Launch configurations"=456 -l
   AutoScaling/Auto Scaling groups                        321
   AutoScaling/Launch configurations                      456
   CloudFormation/Stacks                                  1000 (API)
   EBS/Active snapshots                                   20000 (TA)
   EBS/Active volumes                                     6500 (TA)
   (...)
   VPC/Rules per network ACL                              20
   VPC/Subnets per VPC                                    200
   VPC/VPCs                                               1000 (TA)



This example simply sets the overrides, and then prints the limits for confirmation.

Check Limits Against Thresholds
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default mode of operation for ``awslimitchecker`` (when no other action-specific
options are specified) is to check the usage of all known limits, compare them against
the configured limit values, and then output a message and set an exit code depending
on thresholds. The limit values used will be (in order of precedence) explicitly-set
overrides, Trusted Advisor data, and hard-coded defaults.

Currently, the ``awslimitchecker`` command line script only supports global warning and
critical thresholds, which default to 80% and 99% respectively. If any limit's usage is
greater than or equal to 80% of its limit value, this will be included in the output
and the program will exit with return code 1. If any limit's usage is greater than or
equal to 99%, it will include that in the output and exit 2. When determining exit codes,
critical takes priority over warning. The output will include the specifics of which limits
exceeded the threshold, and for limits that are per-resource, the resource IDs.

The Python class allows setting thresholds per-limit as either a percentage, or an integer
usage value, or both; this functionality is not currently present in the command line wrapper.

To check all limits against their thresholds (in this example, one limit has crossed the warning
threshold only, and another has crossed the critical threshold):

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker --no-color
   CloudFormation/Stacks                                  (limit 1000) WARNING: 812
   EC2/Security groups per VPC                            (limit 500) CRITICAL: vpc-c89074a9=983
   EC2/VPC security groups per elastic network interface  (limit 5) CRITICAL: eni-c2d513fb=5 WARNING: e (...)
   ELB/Active load balancers                              (limit 600) WARNING: 493
   ElastiCache/Clusters                                   (limit 50) WARNING: 44
   (...)
   ElasticBeanstalk/Environments                          (limit 200) CRITICAL: 382
   S3/Buckets                                             (limit 100) CRITICAL: 224
   VPC/NAT gateways                                       (limit 5) CRITICAL: 8



Set Custom Thresholds
++++++++++++++++++++++

To set the warning threshold of 50% and a critical threshold of 75% when checking limits:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -W 97 --critical=98 --no-color
   EC2/Security groups per VPC                            (limit 500) CRITICAL: vpc-c89074a9=983
   EC2/VPC security groups per elastic network interface  (limit 5) CRITICAL: eni-c2d513fb=5
   ElasticBeanstalk/Application versions                  (limit 500) CRITICAL: 1761
   ElasticBeanstalk/Applications                          (limit 25) CRITICAL: 133
   ElasticBeanstalk/Environments                          (limit 200) CRITICAL: 382
   S3/Buckets                                             (limit 100) CRITICAL: 224
   VPC/NAT gateways                                       (limit 5) CRITICAL: 8



Required IAM Policy
++++++++++++++++++++

``awslimitchecker`` can also provide the user with an IAM Policy listing the minimum
permissions for it to perform all limit checks. This can be viewed with the
``--iam-policy`` option:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker --iam-policy
   {
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Action": [
           "autoscaling:DescribeAccountLimits",
   (...)
       }
     ],
     "Version": "2012-10-17"
   }



For the current IAM Policy required by this version of awslimitchecker,
see :ref:`IAM Policy <iam_policy>`.

Connect to a Specific Region
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To connect to a specific region (i.e. ``us-west-2``), simply specify the region
name with the ``-r`` or ``--region`` options:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -r us-west-2

Assume a Role in Another Account with STS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To assume the "foobar" role in account 123456789012 in region us-west-1,
specify the ``-r`` / ``--region`` option as well as the ``-A`` / ``--sts-account-id``
and ``-R`` / ``--sts-account-role`` options:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -r us-west-1 -A 123456789012 -R foobar

If you also need to specify an ``external_id`` of "myid", you can do that with the
``-E`` / ``--external-id`` options:

.. code-block:: console

   (venv)$ awslimitchecker -r us-west-1 -A 123456789012 -R foobar -E myid

Please note that this assumes that you already have STS configured and working
between your account and the 123456789012 destination account; see the
`documentation <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_ for further information.
