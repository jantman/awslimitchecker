A script and python module to check your AWS service limits and usage, and warn when usage approaches limits.

Users building out scalable services in Amazon AWS often run into AWS' `service limits <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html>`_ -
often at the least convenient time (i.e. mid-deploy or when autoscaling fails). Amazon's `Trusted Advisor <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/>`_
can help this, but even the version that comes with Business and Enterprise support only monitors a small subset of AWS limits
and only alerts *weekly*. awslimitchecker provides a command line script and reusable package that queries your current
usage of AWS resources and compares it to limits (hard-coded AWS defaults that you can override, API-based limits where available, or data from Trusted
Advisor where available), notifying you when you are approaching or at your limits.

Status
-------

This project has just undergone a relatively major refactor to migrate from
`boto <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/>`_ to `boto3 <http://boto3.readthedocs.org/>`_,
along with a refactor of much of the connection and usage gathering code. Until
it's been running in production for a while, please consider this to be "beta"
and make every effort to manually confirm the results for your environment.

What It Does
------------

- Check current AWS resource usage against AWS Service Limits
- Show and inspect current usage
- Override default Service Limits (for accounts with increased limits)
- Compare current usage to limits; return information about limits that
  exceed thresholds, and (CLI wrapper) exit non-0 if thresholds are exceeded
- Define custom thresholds per-limit
- where possible, pull current limits from Trusted Advisor API
- where possible, pull current limits from each service's API (for services that provide this information)
- Supports explicitly setting the AWS region
- Supports using `STS <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_ to assume roles in other accounts, including using ``external_id``.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6 through 3.5.
* Python `VirtualEnv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ and ``pip`` (recommended installation method; your OS/distribution should have packages for these)
* `boto3 <http://boto3.readthedocs.org/>`_ >= 1.2.3
