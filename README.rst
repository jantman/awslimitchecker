A script and python module to check your AWS service limits and usage using `boto <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/>`_.

Users building out scalable services in Amazon AWS often run into AWS' `service limits <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html>`_ -
often at the least convenient time (i.e. mid-deploy or when autoscaling fails). Amazon's `Trusted Advisor <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/>`_
can help this, but even the version that comes with Business and Enterprise support only monitors a small subset of AWS limits
and only alerts *weekly*. awslimitchecker provides a command line script and reusable package that queries your current
usage of AWS resources and compares it to limits (hard-coded AWS defaults that you can override, or data from Trusted
Advisor where available), notifying you when you are approaching or at your limits.

Full project documentation is available at `http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org <http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org>`_.

Status
------

This project is currently in very early development. At this time please consider it beta code and not fully tested in all situations;
furthermore its API may be changing rapidly. I hope to have this stabilized soon.

What It Does
------------

- Check current AWS resource usage against AWS Service Limits
- Show and inspect current usage
- Override default Service Limits (for accounts with increased limits)
- Compare current usage to limits; return information about limits that
  exceed thresholds, and (CLI wrapper) exit non-0 if thresholds are exceeded
- Define custom thresholds per-limit
- where possible, pull current limits from Trusted Advisor API
- Supports explicitly setting the AWS region
- Supports using `STS <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_ to assume roles in other accounts, including using ``external_id``.

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6 through 3.4. Python 2.x is recommended, as `boto <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/>`_ (the AWS client library) currently has
  incomplete Python3 support. See the `boto documentation <http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for a list of AWS services that are Python3-compatible.
* Python `VirtualEnv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_ and ``pip`` (recommended installation method; your OS/distribution should have packages for these)
* `boto <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/>`_ >= 2.32.0

Installation
------------

It's recommended that you install into a virtual environment (virtualenv /
venv). See the `virtualenv usage documentation <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_
for information on how to create a venv. If you really want to install
system-wide, you can (using sudo).

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install awslimitchecker

Credentials
-----------

Aside from STS, awslimitchecker does nothing with AWS credentials, it leaves that to boto itself.
You must either have your credentials configured in one of boto's supported config
files, or set as environment variables. See
`boto config <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html>`_
and
`this project's documentation <http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html#credentials>`_
for further information.

When using STS, you will need to specify the ``-r`` / ``--region`` option as well as the ``-A`` / ``--sts-account-id``
and ``-R`` / ``--sts-account-role`` options to specify the Account ID that you want to assume a role in, and the
name of the role you want to assume. If an external ID is required, you can specify it with ``-E`` / ``--external-id``.

Usage
-----

For basic usage, see:

.. code-block:: bash

    awslimitchecker --help

See the `project documentation <http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org>`_
for further information.

also happy to accept contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests, testing, etc.

License
-------

awslimitchecker is licensed under the `GNU Affero General Public License, version 3 or later <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html>`_.
This shouldn't be much of a concern to most people.

If you're simply *running* awslimitchecker, all you must do is provide a notice on where to get the source code
in your output; this is already handled via a warning-level log message in the package. If you modify awslimitchecker's
code, you must update this URL to reflect your modifications (see ``awslimitchecker/version.py``).

If you're distributing awslimitchecker with modifications or as part of your own software (as opposed to simply a
requirement that gets installed with pip), please read the license and ensure that you comply with its terms.

If you are running awslimitchecker as part of a hosted service that users somehow interact with, please
ensure that the source code URL is visible in the output given to users.
