    - [ ] pep8 compliant with some exceptions (see pytest.ini)

    - [ ] All modules should have (and use) module-level loggers.
    - [ ] **Commit messages** should be meaningful, and reference the Issue number
      if you're working on a GitHub issue (i.e. "issue #x - <message>"). Please
      refrain from using the "fixes #x" notation unless you are *sure* that the
      the issue is fixed in that commit.
    - [ ] Git history is fully intact; please do not squash or rewrite history.
